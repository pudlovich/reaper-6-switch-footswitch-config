A small project where I share lua scripts I use to achieve two goals with a 6-button footswitch (with an optional jack extension):
1. Controlling a recording environment so that I don't need to use the keyboard/mouse as much
2. Controlling a DIY foot MIDI keyboard project I will describe in more detail later
